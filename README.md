# beans-rs
A rewrite of the minimal [beans](https://github.com/int-72h/ofinstaller-beans) launcher, but in rust!

Currently, everything is a 1:1 port from the python version, and it's very incomplete!

Just like the python version, this is licensed under `GPLv3` (see LICENSE.txt).

## Developing
At the moment the only dependency is the rust toolchain. Use [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) to easily install it.

## Notes
pls talk to `@kate.pet` if you wanna help out! (remove when this repo goes public)

All the `exe` files in `Binaries` only support x86 platforms! and the other binaries only support (i think) linux w/ glibc. I haven't tested that, but someone probably should. (kate, 2024/05/24)
